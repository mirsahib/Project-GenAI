# Grocery Recommendation System  

### 🛒 **Project Description**  
The Grocery Recommendation System is an intelligent tool that helps users discover recipes based on the groceries they have purchased or already have on their shelves. By leveraging **natural language processing (NLP)**, the system matches users' products to suitable recipes and identifies any missing ingredients. This tool offers personalized recommendations and can enhance the user experience for online grocery stores by acting as a seamless integration into their platforms.

### 🌟 **Motivation**  
When users buy products from online grocery stores, they often wonder:  
- *What dishes can I make with these items?*  
- *What additional ingredients do I need to prepare a specific recipe?*  

This project aims to solve this problem by providing tailored recipe recommendations based on a user's purchased products. It also highlights missing ingredients, helping users make informed decisions. This feature can be a valuable addition to online grocery platforms, improving user engagement and satisfaction.
